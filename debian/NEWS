libdatetime-format-strptime-perl (1.7600-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes:

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  * The ability to set the pattern, time_zone, and locale via accessor methods
    has been removed. This was deprecated over three years ago in version
    1.60. It also turns out that the setting was actually broken for a long
    time but no one seemed to notice, so I think it's safe to remove this
    feature.

libdatetime-format-strptime-perl (1.6000-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes:

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  - The error messages for various types of failures have changed.

  - The never-documented diagnostic parameter for the constructor has been
    removed.

  - The never-documented feature to allow you to use arbitrary DateTime.pm
    methods in the parsing pattern has been removed. This never made much sense
    anyway, since most DateTime.pm methods are not constructor params, but they
    were used that way.

  - Using the pattern, locale, and time_zone to set the respective attribute is
    now deprecated. Make a new object instead of changing one of these values.
